/*
  Use this file to organize custom middleware and additional middleware imported from microApp-core.

  Use the "settings" field to set under which execution states your middleware should be run.

  To run a middleware for all message types set settings to:
  {
    isBulk: [true, false],
    eventType: ['fetch', 'transition', 'webhook'],
  }
  to exclude an eventType or single/bulk group, remove its value from the appropriate array.

  To utilize additional features from microApp core:
   - import a named middleware from the documentation, such as "withCrmData"
   - add a entry in the "microAppMiddleware" array with the import as the "middleware" property
   - use the "settings" field as described above
*/

export const microAppMiddleware = [
