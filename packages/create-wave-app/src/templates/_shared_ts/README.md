<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to begin creating with your create-wave-app repo.

### Installation

1. We recommend creating a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything
   automatically for you. To create a project, run:
   ```sh
   npx create-wave-app@latest
   ```
2. On installation, you'll see the following prompts:
   ```sh
   1. What would you like to name your project? my-app
   2. Please enter a description for your project: my-app description
   3. Would you like to link your project to GitHub? No / Yes
      If Yes:
      - What is your GitHub email?
      - What is your GitHub username?
      - What is your GitHub token?
   4. Which package manager do you want to use? npm / yarn
   5. Generate? No / Yes
   ```
3. After the prompts, create-wave-app will create a folder with your project name. Navigate to your
   new project and run one of the falling depending on your answer to question 4 above.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```sh
